## Assignment Instructions

This assignment uses techniques learned from the Gathering and Cleansing Data course to gather data from multiple file sources and merge them into a single tidy data set. 

Data sources: 
* Originating article: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
* Data set: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

If you wish to successfuly run the code, you will need to download the .zip file, extract it to your working directory and rename the folder to "data". The run_analysis.R script will be in the working directory and will reference ./data/ for the data sets.
